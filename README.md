# Hardware Basics

## What is Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer system—these are the parts you can touch and interact with. Unlike software, which consists of programs and operating systems that run on a computer, hardware includes tangible components such as the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. These parts work together to perform tasks, process data, and enable interaction with the digital world.

<details>
  <summary>Overview of Hardware</summary>

- Hardware is essential because it provides the foundation for all computer operations.
- It’s divided into internal and external components, each playing specific roles in computer functionality.
- Properly understanding hardware helps in troubleshooting, upgrading, and optimizing computer performance.

# Computer Components

## What are Computer Components?

Computer components are the individual parts that make up a computer system, working together to execute tasks. Each component has a distinct function, contributing to the overall operation of the computer.

  <summary>Key Components of a Computer</summary>

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**:
   - The “brain” of the computer that processes instructions and performs calculations.
   - Executes tasks in programs, like opening files, browsing, and running applications.

2. **Memory (RAM)**:
   - Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores data for quick access by the CPU.
   - RAM impacts speed and multitasking capabilities, allowing for the efficient running of multiple applications.

3. **Storage Drive (HDD/SSD)**:
   - Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are used to store data permanently.
   - SSDs are generally faster and more efficient, while HDDs offer more storage capacity at a lower cost.

4. **Motherboard**:
   - The main circuit board connecting all components of the computer.
   - Acts as the backbone, allowing communication between the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.

5. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**:
   - Supplies power to all computer components.
   - Ensures stable power distribution to avoid system failures and component damage.

6. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**:
   - Also known as a video card, the GPU is essential for rendering images, videos, and animations.
   - Vital for tasks involving high graphics processing, such as gaming or video editing.

7. **Cooling System**:
   - Includes fans, heat sinks, or liquid coolers that prevent components from overheating.
   - Essential for maintaining system performance and longevity.

8. **Input and Output Devices (Peripherals)**:
   - Devices such as the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which allow users to interact with the computer.
   - Essential for inputting commands and viewing outputs.
