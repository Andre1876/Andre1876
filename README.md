# Hardware Basics

## What is Hardware?

Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer system—these are the parts you can touch and interact with. Unlike software, which consists of programs and operating systems that run on a computer, hardware includes tangible components such as the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. These parts work together to perform tasks, process data, and enable interaction with the digital world.

<details>
  <summary>Overview of Hardware</summary>

- Hardware is essential because it provides the foundation for all computer operations.
- It’s divided into internal and external components, each playing specific roles in computer functionality.
- Properly understanding hardware helps in troubleshooting, upgrading, and optimizing computer performance.

# Computer Components

## What are Computer Components?

Computer components are the individual parts that make up a computer system, working together to execute tasks. Each component has a distinct function, contributing to the overall operation of the computer.

<details>
  <summary>Key Components of a Computer</summary>

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**:
   - The “brain” of the computer that processes instructions and performs calculations.
   - Executes tasks in programs, like opening files, browsing, and running applications.

2. **Memory (RAM)**:
   - Random Access Memory (RAM) temporarily stores data for quick access by the CPU.
   - RAM impacts speed and multitasking capabilities, allowing for the efficient running of multiple applications.

3. **Storage Drive (HDD/SSD)**:
   - Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are used to store data permanently.
   - SSDs are generally faster and more efficient, while HDDs offer more storage capacity at a lower cost.

4. **Motherboard**:
   - The main circuit board connecting all components of the computer.
   - Acts as the backbone, allowing communication between the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.

5. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**:
   - Supplies power to all computer components.
   - Ensures stable power distribution to avoid system failures and component damage.

6. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**:
   - Also known as a video card, the GPU is essential for rendering images, videos, and animations.
   - Vital for tasks involving high graphics processing, such as gaming or video editing.

7. **Cooling System**:
   - Includes fans, heat sinks, or liquid coolers that prevent components from overheating.
   - Essential for maintaining system performance and longevity.

8. **Input and Output Devices (Peripherals)**:
   - Devices such as the keyboard, mouse, and monitor, which allow users to interact with the computer.
   - Essential for inputting commands and viewing outputs.

# Operating Systems & Software Basics

## What is an Operating System?

An Operating System (OS) is the fundamental software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, making it easier to execute programs and perform various tasks on a computer. Without an OS, the hardware would be unusable.

<details>
  <summary>Overview of Operating Systems</summary>

- An OS handles the basic functions like managing files, executing applications, and interacting with peripheral devices.
- It provides a user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with the machine in a meaningful way.
- Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile OS like iOS and Android.

## What is Software?

Software refers to the programs and applications that run on a computer, enabling it to perform specific tasks. Unlike hardware, which is physical, software is intangible. It tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Software is classified into two types: system software and application software.

<details>
  <summary>Overview of Software</summary>

- **System Software**: Includes operating systems, device drivers, and utilities that help manage computer resources.
- **Application Software**: Programs like word processors, web browsers, and games designed to help users perform specific tasks.
- Software enables functionality, customization, and performance of computers based on user needs.
