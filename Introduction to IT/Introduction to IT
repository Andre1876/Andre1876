# Hardware Basics

## What is Hardware?
Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system—these are the tangible parts you can touch and interact with. Unlike software, which includes programs and operating systems, hardware includes components such as the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Together, these parts enable tasks, data processing, and interaction with the digital world.

## Types of Networks

### 1. Local Area Network (LAN)
A network within a limited area, like a home or office, enabling resource sharing.

<details>
  <summary>LAN Features</summary>

- High-speed, low-latency connections within a small area.
- Common in offices and schools.

</details>

### 2. Wide Area Network (WAN)
Connects LANs across large distances, using leased lines or the internet.

<details>
  <summary>WAN Features</summary>

- Enables long-distance network connectivity.
- Often has slower speeds and higher latency than LANs.

</details>

### 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A network covering a city or campus, larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.

<details>
  <summary>MAN Features</summary>

- Often used by organizations and universities.
- Provides faster and more reliable connections within a metropolitan area.

</details>
